To compile the project as is, do the following from the Turbulenz environment.

1.	Satisfy dependencies into a single file:

>	maketzjs -t . -o hellopong.js main.js

	That templatel (-t) option is mandatory, or else the tool will have no idea what dependencies to call and from where.
	The output file too is necessary. The input is the last one, of course.

2.	Compile dependency satisfied file to tzjs:

>	maketzjs -t . -o hellopong.tzjs hellopong.js

	Once again, template directory is required.
	Output is the tzjs file, and the last one is the previously dep-satisfied script.
